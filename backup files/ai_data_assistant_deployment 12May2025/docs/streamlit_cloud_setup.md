### Updating Your App
To update your application:

2. Commit and push the changes
3. Streamlit Community Cloud will automatically detect the changes and rebuild your app

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### App Fails to Deploy
If your app fails to deploy, check the build logs for errors:
1. Common issues include:
   - Missing dependencies in requirements.txt
   - Syntax errors in your Python code
   - Incorrect file paths

### App Deploys But Doesn't Work
If your app deploys but doesn't function correctly:
1. Check that your GEMINI_API_KEY secret is correctly set
2. Verify that all required files are in the correct locations
3. Check the app logs for runtime errors

### API Key Issues
If you see errors related to the Gemini API:
1. Verify your API key is correct
2. Check that the key has been properly added to the secrets
3. Ensure your API key has the necessary permissions

## Resource Limits

Streamlit Community Cloud provides free hosting with some limitations:
1. Apps go to sleep after a period of inactivity
2. Limited computational resources
3. Public visibility (anyone with the link can access your app)

For production use cases with higher requirements, consider upgrading to a paid plan or using alternative deployment options.
