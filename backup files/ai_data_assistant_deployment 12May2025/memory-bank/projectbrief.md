# Project Brief: AI Data Analysis Assistant Enhancement

## 1. Project Goal
Enhance the existing AI Data Analysis Assistant to make it more robust, user-friendly, and practical for industry use. This includes adding new features, improving existing functionality, and ensuring the application is well-documented and easy to deploy.

## 2. Core Requirements
*   **Add Reviewer Persona:** Implement a new "Reviewer" persona that can provide strategic oversight and quality control at any stage of the analysis process.
*   **Improve Data Handling:** Implement techniques for handling large datasets, including data chunking and integration with libraries like Dask or Polars.
*   **Enhance Visualization:** Integrate libraries like Plotly, Matplotlib, or Seaborn to generate interactive visualizations directly within the app.
*   **Refine Prompts:** Make the prompt templates more detailed and tailored to the data consulting industry, emphasizing objective and impact-driven thought processes.
*   **Improve Error Handling:** Enhance the AI's ability to detect and report issues in the data or analysis process more effectively.
*   **Comprehensive Report Export:** Enable exporting the entire analysis process into a single, detailed report.

## 3. Scope
The project will focus on modifying the existing Streamlit application code (`app.py` and `src/utils.py`) and updating the `requirements.txt` file. It will also involve creating new prompt templates and integrating new libraries.

## 4. Out of Scope
*   Implementing user authentication or authorization.
*   Integrating with external data sources (e.g., databases, APIs).
*   Developing advanced machine learning models.
*   Deploying the application to a cloud platform.

## 5. Success Criteria
*   The AI Data Analysis Assistant includes a functional Reviewer persona.
*   The application can handle large datasets efficiently.
*   The application generates interactive visualizations.
*   The AI personas provide more insightful and relevant analysis.
*   The application provides comprehensive error handling.
*   The application can export the entire analysis process into a single, detailed report.
*   The codebase is well-documented and easy to maintain.
